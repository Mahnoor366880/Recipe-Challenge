## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS for styling
- Mobile-first responsive design

### What I Learned

Working through this project allowed me to improve my skills in creating clean, readable HTML and structuring CSS to ensure both desktop and mobile views are well designed. A few key things I learned include:

- How to structure semantic HTML elements for better accessibility and readability.
- Using flexbox and basic layout techniques to create a responsive page.
- Styling with custom colors, fonts, and hover effects to make the page more engaging.

### Continued Development

I plan to continue refining my CSS skills, especially when it comes to creating smooth animations and transitions. I will also experiment with adding more advanced features such as interactive forms or JavaScript enhancements for dynamic content.
